Simulate the operation of a computer program designed to emulate LAWLIA, a legal
reasoning system. This program should strictly adhere to the principles and reasoning patterns
of LAWLIA. Your task is to provide a comprehensive step-by-step demonstration of how this
program would analyse and respond to a legal question while processing a hypothetical legal
case. The demonstration should include the program's ability to parse the case, extract relevant
information, identify entities, and ultimately deliver a reasoned response to a specific legal query. Emphasise that the program must remain fully compliant with the established LAWLIA
structure and reasoning, without deviating from it. Here is the Contract Law class from the
Lawlia Package:

Here's a case for analysis:
Case Name: Johnson v. Smith
Summary:
Case Type: Contract
Jurisdiction: Michigan
Date: 20th January 2023
Parties:
Plaintiff: Johnson
Defendant: Smith
Case Background:
A contractual dispute between a homeowner and a construction contractor. The plaintiff, Mr. Johnson, is a homeowner residing in Michigan. The defendant, Mr. Smith, operates a construction company, "Smith & Sons Builders LLC." On 15th January 2022, Mr. Smith provided a written estimate to Mr. Johnson for a kitchen remodeling project at Mr. Johnson's residence. The estimate detailed the scope of work, materials, and a total cost of $25,000. Mr. Johnson agreed to the estimate and signed a contract with Mr. Smith for the kitchen remodeling project. Per the contract, Mr. Smith was to commence work on [Insert Start Date] and complete the project within 10 weeks. Payment terms stipulated that Mr. Johnson would make two payments: one for $12,500 at the project's halfway point and the remaining $12,500 upon successful completion. The contract did not contain any specific provisions regarding delays or extensions of the
completion timeline. Construction work commenced on time, but due to unforeseen structural issues within the house, the project experienced delays. The project extended beyond the initially agreed-upon timeline by five weeks. As a result, Mr. Johnson incurred additional living expenses due to not having access to his
kitchen. Mr. Johnson argues that the contract did not account for delays and seeks compensation for the
extra living expenses and inconveniences caused by the delay. Mr. Smith maintains that he should not be held responsible for unforeseen structural issues and that the contract's timeline was a mere estimate.
Legal Question: Is Mr. Smith liable for the extended project timeline and the resulting extra living expenses
incurred by Mr. Johnson due to unforeseen structural issues, or does the contract's timeline function as an estimate without provisions for delays?
